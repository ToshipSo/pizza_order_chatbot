## Usage

* Bot: Hello, Welcome to YoYo Pizza.
* User: Hi
* Bot: Hi there, How may I help you?
* User: I would like to order pizza.
* Bot: Here is our Menu. We have Farmhouse, Margherita, Indian spice, Desi chutney.
* User: I like Farmhouse.
* Bot: Sure, What pizza size do you want?
* User: I prefer large pizza.

## Train Model
* You can add more user speeches to `trainingSet.csv` file and run `create_classifier.py` to create classifier.
* Run `create_classifier.py` file separately when server is not running.
* `create_classifier.py` will create classifier and save it in `media` folder so it can be used by Django server.

## Application Architecture
Naive Bayes Classifier is used to predict user's text context.
Server predicts the context and based on that chooses a random response from database.
App uses REST API to communicate to server and uses session to remember context during multiple REST requests.
Regular expression is used to take order details.
